**Supervised**

You know the input and output of the processes. For example:
1. Hand written postal code. You need to read all hand written postal code and assign each to number in a computer. 
You can train the algorithm for recognizing the data

**Unsupervised**

You only know the input but no the output. For example:
1. Topics in a set of blogs. You have all the blog at your disposal, but not know which are the topics, 
you need to figure out the topics

**Describing the data**

Matrix like. Each row is the data and the columns are a description of the data. For example
1. Users are described by age, name, shopping list
2. Images are described by grayscale, size, shape

**Categories**
1. Rows are know as _sample_. This are commonly defined with the variable "X"
2. Columns are _features_. this are commonly defined with the variable "y"
3. The _shape_ of the data is the number of _samples_ multiplied by the number of _features_ 
4. The _labels_ are the categories of our _samples_. For example, flower species, breads of dogs
5. The _target_ is the classification of our date set. The _target_ is the whole set of _labels_ 

The data is divide in two parts
1. Training set. For training our model
2. Test set. For testing our model

**Tricks**
1. Visualize the data to find inconsistencies. Use a scatter plot

**Types of problems**
1. Classification. We we want to predict outcomes in a non continue space. For example, predict: languages, species,
yes-no answers
2. Regression. We we want to predict outcomes in a continue space. For example, predict: wages, prices, weights
